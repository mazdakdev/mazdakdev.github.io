It started with love, curiosity, and of course a lot of questions
in my heart. I started this path when I was 10 with c++.
To me being a developer represents the power of creation
& technology is the way to transcend our reality
for evolving towards the truth.

I'm a software developer from Iran, a knowledge-seeker
person who is in love with technology,
AI, development and learning everything he possibly could.
